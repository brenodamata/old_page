<h4>Hi! I'm Breno and I work as a Product & Engineering Manager.</h4>

<p>I'm a product driven backend developer, but I enjoy every step of the workflow process for software development. I have worked full-time as a Software Engineer for 5 years - 4 more years of internships - and nearly a year as a consultant for new and small businesses. For the past two years I have taken my experience to the Product Manager role, working with every team - devs, designers, dev-ops, QA - is honestly the best time I've had working. I get to work in the trenches being hands-on and be part of decision making with upper management. Best part of that is getting to work with most of the people in my company and as a team player, I thrive in it. I have dueled with many programing languages - Java, C#, Ruby, ...- and many frameworks for web development - Rails, Sinatra, .NET, Spring MVC, Ember.</p>

<p>As a football fan I played a little bit myself (for fun), however, my second ACL tear on my left knee made me hang up my cleats. Now my exercise activity of choice is weight lifting, it works wonders on my mood, health and energy level. I rarely decline an invitation to a friendly home game of Hold'em. ‚ô†Ô∏è</p>

<p>Currently consulting for startups. Backend development (Rails) and Product Management are my areas of expertise. I also have proven experience with launch and growth strategies üöÄ. Feel free to send me any questions.</p>

<p>Looking for new and exciting opportunities to work with technology to better our lives and society.</p>
